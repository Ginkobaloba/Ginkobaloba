Hi, I’m Drew (aka Ginkobaloba) 👋

AI Systems Engineer · Undergraduate CS Student · Former C# / Blazor Developer · Distributed Cognition & Robotics Researcher

I’m an undergrad CS student with professional experience in C#/.NET development and a deep interest in building systems inspired by biological cognition from distributed GPU clusters (Project Nexus) to autonomous multi-agent robotics (Project Vector).
My focus is ethically turning theory into living, experimental systems that learn, coordinate, and perceive the world.

💬 Let’s Connect

Open to collaborations in AI, robotics, distributed cognition, and experimental system design. 

If anyone has a small LIDAR system they aren't using, I would put it to great use and I'm sure we could find a way for it to be a tax write-off 😁
